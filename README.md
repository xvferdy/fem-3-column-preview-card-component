## What I learned 🥳
This is my very first trying _mobile first approach_ for designing a website, TBH I'm not really comfortable and this lead me to writing unnecessary **CSS** code. But I will fix my self and study more.

###### src/stylesheets/helpers/\_breakpoints.scss
```scss
@mixin display($breakpoint) {
  @if ($breakpoint == sm-phone) {
  @media only screen and(max-width: 320px) {
    @content;
    }
  }

  @if ($breakpoint == desktop) {
  @media only screen and(min-width: 900px) {
    @content;
  }
 }
}
```

## Difficult Things 😵‍💫
Things were difficult for me and I finally gave up 🤙
- [ ] Try to use `grid`
- [ ] Write a clean **CSS** code
